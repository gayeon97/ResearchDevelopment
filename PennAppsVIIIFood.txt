Inspired by Foodshare
Who’s Foodshare?
* to create a community where all of these people can get all of the food they need. 
* work toward that vision by getting food donations from the food industry and distributing them to 300 food pantries, community kitchens, homeless shelters, and other partner programs.”


PROBLEM:
* only a regional food bank
* cannot keep up with the demand (distributed enough food for 11.5 million meals, but not enough)


SOLUTION:
* using geolocation, the restaurants/supermarkets that will give away food close to an expiration date to those in need - low-income families - will be listed.
* the list of food to be given away will be listed → to prevent ppl going all the distance for nothing


Why our innovation is important:
* yes, there are other methods of getting food → food drive, soup kitchen
* however, the food distributed are not necessarily the food items that ppl need
   * may be allergic
   * may be lactose-intolerant or have other problems
   * may need specific food (ex. Kosher)
* also costs a lot to distribute food to each household
* ppl can argue that it’s illegal to give food that’s close to an expiration date.
   * if the food is kept in the cold chain under 40 degrees and has been unopened, the food can still be consumed for certain number of suggested dates after the expiration date
   * none of this is forced on anyone; we are just posting the possible solution and it’s up to ppl whether they will take up that suggestion or not.
   * either ways, people really don’t want to buy food that is close to an expiration date and the food will be thrown out and be wasted.


How will the interaction with the restaurants/supermarkets happen?
* Community effort.
* first, city council or the village mayor will hold a survey: Are the restaurants willing to donate food that will be thrown away


Future Target Audience:
* Homeless. How do we approach them?
* At bus stops, subways, and market display windows, have a digital screen that lists the items that the stores will give away. the list will be updated daily → user input (stores will contact us and we will update)


Other benefits:
* can create jobs
   * because ppl may be embarrassed to come in and ask for food. also, the employees may be rude towards those who come to get food
   * Hence, there will be a separate door and an employee specially hired to deal with this situation
   * that employee will store and keep track of those food that are nearing the expiration date.
   * throughout the day, the employee will bring the ppl to the food storage place 
* this kind of solution is not just available in US; it can be anywhere
* at this point, technology is readily available in almost all parts of the world.
* it’s about communal & humanitarian effort. we can bridge the gap between the # of food wasted and the # of households that go hungry at night because of lack of food.
